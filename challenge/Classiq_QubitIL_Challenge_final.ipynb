    "The world we live in is inherently non-linear, and numerous industries conduct extensive research leveraging non-linear functions to solve complex problems and drive innovation. In the automotive sector, computational fluid dynamics is used to optimize vehicle efficiency and performance, while in the financial sector, non-linear payoff functions play a cardinal role in modeling and analyzing stock and derivative behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, non-linear functions such as trigonometric, hyperbolic, and fractional powers are indispensable in classical algorithm design. These complex arithmetic functions are often approximated using fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication applied to polynomial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear arithmetic functions also play a pivotal role in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. For instance, the HHL algorithm incorporates an eigenvalue inversion block that relies on the $arcsin(1/x)$ function. The hyperbolic tangent $tanh(x)$ is utilized in applications like Gibbs state preparation in statistical mechanics. Similarly, the sine function $sin(x)$ frequently arises in wave equation solutions and appears in Hamiltonians of quantum systems with periodic potentials, which are instrumental for modeling conduction in metals. Furthermore, these functions can also serve as activation functions in quantum machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even on today’s NISQ devices, implementing generalized arithmetic functions proves valuable for benchmarking and exploring near-term algorithms. However, designing these functions for quantum systems is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of approximating non-linear functions on quantum computers, which inherently rely on linear operations. These implementations often necessitate the use of multiple auxiliary registers to enable out-of-place operations and ensure the accurate approximation of the desired functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the Classiq platform allows you to focus on high-level algorithm design while the platform handles the complexities of optimization and implementation, simplifying the design of efficient quantum arithmetic algorithms and advanced quantum algorithms in general!"
